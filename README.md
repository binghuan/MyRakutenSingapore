## Question1 - Cout up android Application:
Please create android app will do below things;  
	1. Every time user tap the button on the screen, the number will count up like 1,2,3,4,5,.....  
	2. This count up logic is using ndk and user interface is using SDK.  

## Question2 - Meeting room arrangement:

We are thinking to arrange meeting room.  
Meeting room is always noisy, and you are thinking to separate each room users as possible as you can so that they dont feel uncomfortable.  							
If they are facing each other, we will add unhappy point as 1.

Input Data:							
you can use this data as input to show output  
<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qWN57M46rUuik6mLy4Pf8XaBcOjrG6Q7>				
								
Your program in repl.it has to show output right away once we press the 'run' button						
so either putting given data into code or using stdin in repl are fine								
	*Reference* Expected result:							
		Here is expected answer from above data: Please resolve this with your program
